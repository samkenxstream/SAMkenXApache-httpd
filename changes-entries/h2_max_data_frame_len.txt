  *) mod_http2: new directive 'H2MaxDataFrameLen n' to limit the maximum
     amount of response body bytes put into a single HTTP/2 DATA frame.
     Setting this to 0 places no limit (but the max size allowed by the
     protocol is observed).
     The module, by default, tries to use the maximum size possible, which is
     somewhat around 16KB. This sets the maximum. When less response data is
     available, smaller frames will be sent.
